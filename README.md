## Roadmap

1. \[Not Started\] Settings for the approach guides (target port rings and current craft pointer)
    * Adjust ring thickness
    * Enable/Disable rings, Enable/Disable pointer
1. \[Not Started\] Adjustment for UI font size (doesn't look great when the UI is scaled)
1. \[Not Started\] Add new keyboard controls for translation without toggling translation mode (Default bindings: U-I-O-J-K-L)
1. \[Not Started\] On screen clickable controls
1. \[Not Started\] In game sensitivity adjustment sliders (for translation control sensitivity or rotation control sensitivity or both)

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this mod and I would like to make it as easy as possible. If you want to work on something just submit a pull request changing this README file to have your SR2 Website username next to the roadmap item you are working on, and then submit another pull request with the functionality implemented. Following the existing coding style is appreciated, but beyond that if it works and doesn't add uneccessary files I will merge it.
